Usually, farmers employ daily laborers for a certain farm activity, or construction companies employ daily laborers for their work. But they don't pay them daily, I would be at the end of said work, which is when they might receive payment. 
They usually have a book to keep track of who worked on which days, hours of work, and so on. Most of the time during payment there will be a hassle about, the no. of days/ hours worked, and since the record is only maintained by the employer the laborers would not have a confirmation if they have logged the work done. Or sometimes the laborers might heckle the employer by raising false accusations regarding the days they worked.

So, an app that identifies each laborer/employee by their ph no. or QR code, which allows them to enter the days/hours they worked and track their work log, would hold both parties accountable. We can also send SMS notifications about the outstanding payments and how much they are to be paid to the employer and employee respectively.

Another use case would be for shops near colleges where students usually pay the shopkeepers at the start of the month due to budgetary constraints.

Expansion in the daily wage workers sector would be, we can have job listings in the app so that it's easier for them to get jobs. Also integrating Digi payment software can be used to make direct bank transfers.
