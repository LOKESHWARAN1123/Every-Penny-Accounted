Usually farmers employ daily labourers for a certian farm activity, or construction company employ daily labourers for their work. But they don;t pay them daily, i would be at the end of said work, is when they might recieve payment.
They usually have a book to keep track of who worked on which days, hours of work and so on.
Most of the time during payment there will be a hassle about, the no. of days/ hours worked , and since the record is only maintained by the employer the labourers would not have an confirmation if they have logged the work done.
Or sometime the labourers might heckle the employer by rising false aqusations regarding the days they worked.

So, an app that identifies each labourer/employee by their ph no. or QR code, which allows them to enter the days/hours they worked and track their work log , would hold both parties accountable. we can also send sms notifications about the outstanding payements and how much they are to be paid to employer and employee respectively.

Other use case would be for shops near clgs where students usually pay the shopkeepers at the start of the month due to budgetary constraints.

Expansion in the daily wage workers sector would be, we can have job lisitings in the app,so that its easier for them to get jobs.
Also integrating digi payement softwares can be used to make direct bank transfers.
